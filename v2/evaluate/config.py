TOOL NAME: {tool_name}
TOOL PARAMETERS: {tool_parameters}
RESPONSE SCHEMA: {response_schema}

Generate a valid JSON response that matches the schema and would realistically be returned by this tool."""

USER_SIMULATOR_PROMPT = """You are simulating a user with the following persona:

{persona_json}

You are participating in a scenario with these details:

{scenario_json}

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{conversation_history}

TOOL OUTPUTS:
{tool_outputs}

Respond as this user based on their persona and scenario goals.

BEHAVIOR GUIDELINES:
1. If all tasks are completed successfully, end with "CONVERSATION_COMPLETE" and a goodbye message
2. If agent indicates a request is unsupported: don't repeat it, move to another goal or end with "CONVERSATION_COMPLETE"
3. For clarification requests: provide information if it aligns with your persona, explain if you cannot
4. Keep responses natural and realistic for your persona
5. Focus on goals achievable with the agent's demonstrated capabilities
6. Be efficient and direct in your requests - provide complete information upfront when possible
7. Avoid unnecessary back-and-forth by clearly stating all relevant details
8. Maintain a goal-oriented focus to complete tasks in the minimum number of turns"""

AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """{domain_instructions}
You can use tools to answer user questions. Use the tools as soon you have the necessary information. 

You have access to the following tools:
{tool_descriptions}

Generate a valid JSON structure when calling tools:

[
  {{
    "tool": "tool_name",
    "parameters": {{
      "param1": "value1",
      "param2": "value2"
    }}
  }}
]

For multiple tools in one response:
[
  {{ "tool": "tool1", "parameters": {{ "param": "value" }} }},
  {{ "tool": "tool2", "parameters": {{ "param": "value" }} }}
]

REQUIREMENTS OF TOOL CALLS:
• Always use the tool if it helps complete the task
• Use valid JSON with double quotes for keys and string values
• Always wrap the entire call in square brackets [ ]
• Always include both "tool" and "parameters" fields
• Never include explanatory text inside the JSON structure

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Never assume information not explicitly provided by the user
2. Use tools when appropriate instead of making up information
3. Ask for specific missing information needed to use tools
4. Never guess required parameters - ask the user when needed
5. After receiving tool output, respond normally to the user
6. Always use appropriate tools for checking information, performing actions, or retrieving data
7. Use multiple tools in sequence when needed to complete a request
8. Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requests before taking action
9. For vague requests like "transfer money," ask for all specifics first
10. For unsupported requests, respond with "UNSUPPORTED: " and brief explanation
11. For needed clarification, respond with "CLARIFY: " and your question
12. Be efficient and direct - complete tasks in the minimum number of turns
13. Where possible, batch information requests rather than asking for one detail at a time
14. Solve tasks with the fewest steps required while maintaining accuracy
15. Minimize unnecessary explanations unless requested or required for clarity
16. When gathering information, ask for all required parameters in a single response

Solve user requests by gathering necessary information and using appropriate tools only when all required information is provided. Prioritize efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

FINAL_RESPONSE_PROMPT = """Based on the conversation history and the results of the tools you used,

Your response should:
1. Clearly explain what information you found using the tools
2. Answer the user's question completely based on the tool results
3. Be helpful, clear, and concise
4. IMPORTANT: DO NOT include any JSON tool call format in your response
5. IMPORTANT: DO NOT prefix your response with phrases like "Based on the tool results"
